parse_metadata.py: This will parse the pages gather in the first phase. It will give meta_en_prime.csv under each subfolder in metadata.
clean_metadata.ipynb: We clean the data by splitting the tags.

Detecting duplicates on the basis of title and short url is flawed because if there are even the slightest variations in title then the movie 
won't be considered a duplicate.
There is also a problem with filtering duplicates just by short url. There are some movie pairs where the titles are different and the movies
are actually different but they have the same short url. Howeve, I believe we should have just filtered for short_url only because movies like 
Doc West part 1 an 2 have different titles but have the same link.
Scenarios where movies titles are slightly different but are actually the same is quite abundant.
